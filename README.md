Machine learning projects during my internnship at Codsoft

# ðŸ“Œ Task 1 - SMS Spam Classifier | CodSoft ML Internship
This project is part of my *Machine Learning Internship* at *CodSoft*.  
The goal of this task is to build a model that can classify SMS messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam (Ham)* using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## ðŸ§  Project Objective
To develop a spam detection model using:
- *Text preprocessing*
- *Feature extraction* (TF-IDF)
- *Machine Learning algorithms* such as:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)


# ðŸ“Œ Task 2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection | CodSoft ML Internship
This project is part of my *Machine Learning Internship* at *CodSoft*.
The goal of this task is to build a model that can classify credit card transactions as *Fraudulent* or *Legitimate* using Machine Learning techniques.
## ðŸ§  Project Objective
To develop a fraud detection model using:
* *Data preprocessing*
* *Feature scaling*
* *Handling imbalanced data*
* *Machine Learning algorithms* such as:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
