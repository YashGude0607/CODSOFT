# ðŸ“Œ Task 1 - SMS Spam Classifier | CodSoft ML Internship
This project is part of my *Machine Learning Internship* at *CodSoft*.  
The goal of this task is to build a model that can classify SMS messages as *Spam* or *Not Spam (Ham)* using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
## ðŸ§  Project Objective
To develop a spam detection model using:
- *Text preprocessing*
- *Feature extraction* (TF-IDF)
- *Machine Learning algorithms* such as:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
